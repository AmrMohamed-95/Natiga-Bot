# Natiga-Bot

## Description
The day before my examination result my college announced "The result will appear tomorrow at 2 pm and it will be available for only two hours before being blocked"
I knew that I would be sleeping at that time so I had to come up with a solution.
So I made this bot that every 20 minutes after 2pm opens the result link on firefox, enters my id and password then takes screenshots of the result and save it.
